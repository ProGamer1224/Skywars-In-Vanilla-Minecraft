This is a skywars map, but in vanilla minecraft, it was made for 1.18.2 (IDK if it works on the 1.19 pre-release) and it has 1.8 combat using the attribute command, it is a 2 player map, and you could set up a server to play with friends.

If you use this map, even if you modify it, please give me credit by linking my github page, thank you.
